# Rails 7 on Steroids
## PostCSS + TailwindCSS + Templates + Importmap + Hotwire + LiveReload

This is my preferred Rails Project Setup

This project includes PostCSS, with TailwindCSS. This allows us to easily separate out and scale styles via different files imported by postcss-import.
- Can use stuff from TailwindCSS e.g. `@screen md`, `@apply`
- With Importmap can easily scale our Javascript with ES Modules
- With LiveReload the application automatically reloads whenever there are changes made in development

Feel free to copy, fork, change, use this project for anything you might need it for. This project serves as a Rails Project Template.

Suggestions are highly welcome, this was a quick project setup, improvements to this readme will be greately appriciated.
