# Rails 7 on Steroids
## PostCSS + TailwindCSS + Templates + Importmap

This is my preferred Rails Project Setup.

This project includes PostCSS, with TailwindCSS. Allows us to easily separate out and scale styles via different files imported by postcss-import. We can use things like TailwindCSS `@screen md`, `@apply` etc.

With Importmap we can easily scale our Javascript with ES Modules.

Feel free to copy, fork, change, use this project for anything you might need it for. This project serves as a Rails Project Template.

Suggestions are highly welcome, this was a quick project setup, improvements to this readme will be greately appriciated.
